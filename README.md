# Skin-Cancer-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
I have used CNN for feature extraction and saved those features in a csv file which can be used in future to train other models.
To train the model i have used K-fold method and have taken the average accuracy.
I have also compared multiple NN with CNN like ONN and SNN all the other codes will be uploaded in due time.
You can find the dataset for Skin Cancer in Kaggle
